This code was created by Juniper Lovato juniper.lovato@uvm.edu and Parisa Suchdev parisa.suchdev@uvm.edu for the Data Science 1 Course Spring 2022

Data privacy is an integral issue that indirectly impacts people from all around the world. A greater understanding of the side effects
caused by the collection, processing, and transfer of this data is needed in order for consumers to protect their digital autonomy.
Privacy policies are the public-facing document that explains to consumers how data processors collect, use and share consumer data.
In the bigger picture, e use natural language processing (NLP) tools and methods to investigate the privacy policy corpus and examine
which types of information data processors collect, use, and share. We aim to understand what types of data processors collect from
consumers and how that data flows to third parties. 

The biggest problem related to this project lies with the open problem of natural language processing: Document Segmentation. There are tons are policy texts and in order to divide those policy texts by sections to determine how companies collect, use and share consumer data, data segmentation plays crucial role.

We take few samples out of a huge corpus of policy texts, divide sections according to headings (collect, use, share) and label them accordingly.

This project aims to performs a document segmentation by turning the problem into multi-binary classification problem.

To run this project:
1. Download the hand labelled dataset along with jupyter notebook file.
2. run jupyter notebook on your preferred platform and run the notebook file
